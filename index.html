<h1>Gentrification Doesn't Mean "Whiteness." </h1>


<h2> by Elba T. Rodriguez </h2>

<h3> 16 Dec. 2021</h3>

<p> Rents are high, incomes are low, and gentrification is the word on everyone’s lips. In East Harlem, the median income is $33,720 while the average for a one-bedroom apartment is $2,195. This comes to 78% of one’s monthly income and East Harlem is not alone in this trend, the same applies to locations across the five boroughs. And while the consensus has been to point the finger at an influx of White people, the White population in New York City has been on a steady decline for the past 50 years.  </p>

<p>In his 2011 book, "Harlem: The Four Hudred Year History from Dutch Village to Capital of Black America," Jonathan Gill writes, "In the 1980s . . . many longtime residents didn't quite know what to think about the gentler wave of gentrification that was being led by middle-class African-Americans whose parents had fled decades earlier. Once again, race wasn't the issue, nor was it the solution." This is an issue of class and the changing job market. No longer is manual labor the way. As jobs become more sophisticated, incomes go up and the market inflates to follow the trend.</p>
